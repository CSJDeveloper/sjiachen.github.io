I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) supervised by Prof. [Baochun Li](https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/bli/). Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked as a research assistant in [Professor Chau Yuen's Lab](https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/chau-yuen/). I received my B.Sc. and M.S. degrees in Information and Communication Engineering from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/), Xi'an, China, in 2011 and 2015, respectively. My research focuses on multimodal machine learning, sequential decision-making, distributed systems, and networking.

__Research Highlights__
- _Perception_: capturing explicit relationships for visual-language data in the world.
- _Reasoning_: building sequential decision-making algorithms for reliable problem-solving.
- _Efficiency_: enabling faster and secure perception and reasoning in large-scale networks.
- _AI for Science_: applying generative models to practical problems in telecommunications.

__Academic Projects__
- _[llmpebase](https://github.com/iQua/llmpebase)_: A platform for developing reasoning mechanisms in large language models.
- _[vggbase](https://github.com/iQua/vggbase)_: A platform for designing and assessing image-text alignment methods.
- _[personalized fl](https://github.com/TL-System/plato/tree/main/examples/personalized_fl)_: Implementations of diverse personalized federated learning (FL) methods.
- _[ssl fl](https://github.com/TL-System/plato/tree/main/examples/ssl)_: Implementations of self-supervised learning methods within the federated paradigm.
